## Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture 

This week we learned about security culture and how to promote it within organizations. 

It’s important that all employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyberattacks aim to exploit human weaknesses with methods like phishing. 

For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses. 

### Scenario

- Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work. 

- Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones. 

- Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.

- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications. 

- You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

### Instructions

Compose the answers to the following four steps in a Google Doc.

#### Step 1: Measure and Set Goals 

Answer the following questions:

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
   
    ***Phishing campaigns*** - *employees may provide their company credentials to the wrong person through an unfiltered site while using their own device for work.*
    ***Malware*** - *with BYOD people are able to download outside tools and services to their own device to help them with work. Sometimes these tools may not be secure and a threat actor can attach their own codes to these software. This could change the security features of the software and allow threat actors to have access to the employee’s device.*
    ***Stolen/Lost Devices*** - *Employees can be taking their own devices to many different places and could be robbed at increasing the likelihood of the device being stolen/lost. Whereas a device that is only used on company property could have more security measures than an employee device. This could result in data leakage if the device gets in the hand of a threat actor*

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? 
    - For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources. 
    
    ***Phishing campaign*** - *Avoid opening emails from unknown senders and report any suspicious emails to the security department*
    ***Malware*** - *block the download of malicious or unknown downloads*
    ***Stolen/Lost Device*** - *employees report which of their own devices they are using for company purposes and if any of their devices stolen/missing as soon as possible to the IT department*

https://digitalguardian.com/blog/byod-security-expert-tips-policy-mitigating-risks-preventing-breach

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently _not_ behaving according to the preferred behavior? 
    - For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders. 

    ***Phishing Campaign*** - *launch company wide phishing campaigns to see how many people are not behaving according to the preferred behaviour*
    ***Malware*** - *monitor what files/softwares employees are downloading and how often they are downloading malicious software*
    ***Lost/Stolen Device*** - *measure how often employees report missing/stolen devices and how long after the incident that they are making a report*

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? 
    - For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments. 

    ***Phishing Campaign*** - *Would like to have 0% of people*
    ***Malware*** - *Would like to have 0% of people*
    ***Lost/Stolen Device*** - *Would like to have less than 5% of people*


#### Step 2: Involve the Right People 

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?  

- Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be. 

***HR*** - *The HR team will work alongside the IT department to implement proper employee guidelines to maintain company security. HR is also vital in implementing adequate cybersecurity awareness training for all employees in a given company.*
***CEO*** - *In the event that there is a security threat/data breach, the CEO must be informed about the situation so that they are able to relay the information to board members and investors. The CEO would also be responsible for identifying whether an external security needs to be hired to mitigate the risk and approve policies to prevent future breaches.*
***IT/Security Team*** - *This department would be responsible for mitigating any security breaches in a given company. They would also be responsible for implementing technical measures to prevent future breaches.*
***Communication Department*** - *The communication Department is required to conduct crisis communication in the event that there is a security breach. The communication department will work alongside the IT department to determine the appropriate timeframe to announce the breach and what strategies will be used to communicate it based on the attack that has taken place.*
***Financial Department*** - *This is the department that is most often targeted by threat agents. Also in the event that a security risk becomes a ransomware attack, the financial department is required to assess how much ransom they can afford to pay.*

#### Step 3: Training Plan 

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:

* How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

* What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

* After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 

This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda. 

***Training frequency*** - *every 4 months online*
https://infimasec.com/blog/training-frequency/#:~:text=We%20recommend%20most%20organizations%20start,courses%20per%20year%2C%20ideally%20quarterly.
**Training Topics**
1. ***BYOD Training*** *(The purpose of this training is to provide employees a clear understanding of the policy itself. Definitions of some common terms in this policy should be discussed during this portion of the training. Employees will be informed of important guidelines within the policy.)*
    ***Definitions:*** 
        *Bring Your Own Device*
        *Mobile Device Managements and any other softwares that will be required for their job*
    ***Device compatibility:*** *clearly outline what devices are permitted and are compatible with any software that will need to be downloaded*
    ***Technical Support:*** *Outline how employees are able receive support regarding technical issues for their own device*
    ***Accessing company resources:*** *This section of the training will be used to teach employees how to access company resources securely. This can prevent data leakage due employee errors while accessing remote servers.*
    ***Data ownership:*** *This section will inform employees which data is company property. It will also highlight the difference between company and personal data. Once the two types of data have mixed together, this section will discuss what the company controls on the device.*
https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-essential-elements-of-byod-training/

2. ***Physical Security Training*** *(This section of the training will focus on steps to prevent and manage incidents of stolen/missing devices. This includes steps the employee can take and how the company will support/manage the incident if the device cannot be recovered.)*
    ***Passwords:*** *This section will provide employees training on developing complex passwords, using different passwords for each set of credentials, and how all of the credentials can be managed securely. This will provide an extra layer of security in the event that the person who stole the device does not know how to hack the device.*
    ***Reporting Stolen/Missing Device:*** *This section of the training will explain the steps that the employees will take to report a stolen/missing device.*
    ***MDM and MAM (Remote wipe):*** *This section discusses company action if the device cannot be recovered. In this case, this section would inform employees of how the device will be wiped if the device cannot be recovered. It will inform them on whether they will also lose any of their personal data.*

3. ***Phishing Attacks*** *(This section of the training involves creating employee awareness of phishing attacks. This has been one of the most common forms of attack experienced by many companies. Departments such as the financial department have been commonly targeted for ransom through these attacks.)*
    ****Definition of Phishing:*** *There are often many employees in a given company that do not know or understand what a phishing attack is. As a result, they become victims to such an attack. This section of the training will also help employees identify a potential phishing attack as a preventative measure.*
        ***Verify Sender of an Email:*** *Threat actors could use the name of real employees in the company in a phishing attack but will have a random email address.* 
        ***Downloading Attachments:*** *Attachments can also pose security threats that are not as easily filtered as a link in the body of the email. Avoiding downloading suspicious attachments can prevent this threat.*
        ***Emails that Evoke Emotions:*** *If an email is evoking any form of emotion, it typically is an indicator of a potential phishing attack. The email will create a sense of urgency that may cause an employee to respond before verifying if the email is from an authorized sender.*
    ***Simulations:*** *Providing simulations for the employees will allow them to become more familiar with identifying potential phishing attacks. The more opportunities the employees get the better they will at avoiding these forms of attacks in the future.*

4. ***Malware:*** *(This section will outline what malware is and how it affects a device. Employees will also learn how to prevent and what to do if they experience a malware attack.)*
    ***Definition:*** *Many employees may not know what malware is which makes them an easier target for the attack. By providing them a definition they may be able to avoid it.*
    ***Personal Device:*** *This section of the training will focus on downloading suspicious software onto their own device which will be used for the BYOD policy. Employees will learn about techniques to identify whether the software is from an authorized source. Employees will also learn about procedures to get in touch with IT if they are not sure about the software that they wish to download.*
    ***Removable Media:*** *This section will educate employees on how removable devices can also carry unauthorized softwares and can result in a malware attack*
    ***Antivirus:*** *Employees will learn about what an Anti-virus is, what is an approved anti-virus (if the company prefers a specific anti-virus), and how often to scan for virus.*
    ***Informing IT department:*** *Employees will be informed of procedures and guidelines they must follow if they are faced with a malware attack. This will include how to get in touch with the IT department. They will be provided with a brief overview of what might happen if the attack is successful (ex. Computer may need to be wiped).*

**Measuring Effectiveness**
    ***Audits:*** *Audits will be conducted every 4 months before each of the training sessions. If there is a certain component of the security training that employees struggle to comply with, future training will have an increased focus on those components in comparison to the others. The audits will include remote access of the personal devices to verify that they maintain company security. 
    *The previous measures of employees will also be maintained and reviewed during the Audits.*

#### Bonus: Other Solutions

Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern. 

- Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following: 

    * What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical? 

    * What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?

    * What is one advantage of each solution? 

    * What is one disadvantage of each solution? 
***1. Removing the BYOD policy and creating a policy that does not allow employees to use their own devices or access company information on unauthorized devices.***
    *Administrative*
    *Preventative*
    *Advantages:*
        *Don't have to worry about the personal data mixing with company data*
        *Employees and the company would not have to worry about privacy/confidentiality*
        *Less chance of data leakage*
        *Disgruntled company would not automatically have access to company data*
    *Disadvantages:*
        *The company will have to spend more money on buying devices and having IT professionals set them up*
        *If the company only provides desktops, there will be a higher turnover rate since they will not be able to offer the option of remote work like similar companies*
***2. Employees have the IT department install a software to be able to use their personal device for them to use it for company purposes. The software will allow employees to access company data/resources. The IT departments will be able to use the software to track employee locations, when the employee is active on the device, remotely wipe data, monitor websites visited and any downloads initiated by the employee.***
    *Technical*
    *Preventative*
    *Advantages:*
        *Employees will still be able to use their own devices
        Saves company the expense* 
    *Disadvantages:*
        *The software itself could be attacked which could result in employees not being able to access company data or IT departments not being able to remotely support the employees*
